Coding Bootcamp HW12 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**bAmazon** is a node CLI shopping app built by Kyle Rosenmeyer. It uses mysql as a back end to deliver a shopping experience to customers, inventory tools for managers, and sales tools for supervisors.

This app is useful to learn the principals of using mysql and node together to build useful applications.

This project is not available for additional contribution from the github community, however
